This extension will save you from reading any Avengers: Endgame or Game Of Thrones Spoilers as well as visual images.

This was my first Google Chrome Extension.

### Features
- **Spoiler Blocking**: Searches entire web page and replaces Spoilers with text `##BLOCKED -- [SPOILER DETECTED]`
- **Image Blurring**: Blurs the neighbouring Images which are relevant and might reveal the Spoiler information.

### How To Use?
- Clone this repository(using git) or download as a zip file
- Incase you downloaded as a zip, unzip it
- Open Google Chrome
- Go to `chrome://extensions`
- Click on `Load Unpacked` which you can see in the top left side.
- Select the path where you cloned/downloaded this project.
- An icon <img src="avenger.png"  width="40"/> should appear besides your Chrome Search bar.
- That's all :D. You're GOT will not be spoiled now.
